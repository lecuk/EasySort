# EasySort
Pretty simple visualizer of sorting algorithms.

It's my first program :)

#### Features:
* Displays work of the most famous sorting algorithms like BubbleSort, QuickSort etc;
* Different starting presets of array (sorted, reversed, shuffled);
* Array length is in range from 8 to 8192;
* Few styles of display from default (white) to distance-based, when array piece color is defined by its difference between its value and its position;
* You can adjust working (sorting) speed in real-time.

#### TODO:
* Add more sorting and generating algorithms;
* Add new style "Ascending-descending based"
* Remake UI, separate array generating from shuffling.
* Add localization settings
